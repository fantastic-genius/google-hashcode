	* where each line is a row (i.e an index containing an array) and each character M and T will be passed into the array as 1 and O respectively
- Pick M and T as long as the minimum is nit reached for both

- Check if the mximum Total number of cells have not beign reach

- To check for direction of cut (i.e making decision on direction)
	-Check highest two multiples that will give maximum row and column(i.e for max cell = 6: 3R x 2C)
	- First one step vertically, then one step horizontally
	- To terminate cut for a slice and move to the next slice cut: * When the minimum ingredient of M and T have been reached
	- Save the last position of cut in each row in a key-value pair where key is the index of each row.
		*the saved row is to be used as start position for a new cut that passess through that row
